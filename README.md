# Introduction
This package is designed to integrate the outputs related to a 2x2 consensus table. If we pay attention to the outputs of SAS software, it has a very attractive fragmentation for the outputs related to 2x2 consensus tables. I found this deficiency in R. I was observing, for this reason I decided to put together this set of code which is gathered in the form of a package. Just because the output related to the 2 by 2 consensus tables is more interested in the health care staff, I decided to provide relatively more beautiful tables, for this reason I used the kableExtra package in these codes to draw the tables.
